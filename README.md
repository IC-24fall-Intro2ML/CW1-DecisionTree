# CW1-DecisionTree

This project implements a decision tree algorithm and uses it to determine one of the indoor locations based on WIFI signal strengths collected from a mobile phone.

## How to run the code

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IC-24fall-Intro2ML/CW1-DecisionTree.git
   cd CW1-DecisionTree
   ```

2. Install the required packages

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the code

   ```bash
   python ML_CW1.py
   ```

## Files in the repository

- `ML_CW1.py`: The main code file that implements the decision tree algorithm and uses it to determine the indoor locations based on WIFI signal strengths.

- `data/`: A directory containing the dataset files.

- `Decision_Tree.py`: A file containing the implementation of the decision tree algorithm. (This is just a step by step implementation of the decision tree algorithm, we keep this in the repository just for reference. The final implementation is in `ML_CW1.py`)

- `README.md`: This file.

- `requirements.txt`: A file containing the required packages to run the code.
